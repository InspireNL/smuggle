Description:
    Generates a exporter for a scope with the given name.
    Additionally, you can pass the attributes you want to include in the export.

Example:
    rails generate smuggle:exporter user first_name last_name

    This will create:

    # app/exporter/user_exporter.rb

    class UserExporter < ApplicationExporter
      attributes :first_name, :last_name
    end
