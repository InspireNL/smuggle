Description:
    Generates a importer for a model with the given name.
    You need to pass the attributes to include in the import.

Example:
    rails generate smuggle:importer user first_name last_name

    This will create:

    # app/importer/user_importer.rb

    class UserImporter < ApplicationImporter
      attributes :first_name, :last_name
    end
